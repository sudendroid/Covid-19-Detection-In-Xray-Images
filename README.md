Thanx to Adrian Rosebrock for this wonderfull article https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/03/16/detecting-covid-19-in-x-ray-images-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/

- collect covid-19 chest xray images from github repo https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
  by Dr. Joseph Cohen

- collect normal chest xray images from kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

- use pretrained model from keras (VGG16/ResNet50) for transfer learning
